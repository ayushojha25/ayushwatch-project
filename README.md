Watchcart: Modern Watch Store ProjectThis project is a modern web-based watch store—featuring a stylish shopping page and a secure, animated login screen.FeaturesModern shop page: Category filters, animated backgrounds, neat product listing, and responsive design.Login page: Secure form with animated background, validates user input.How the Login Page WorksLocation: The login page is in home.html.Process:User must enter both a username and a password.If either field is left blank, the form prevents submission and asks to fill the field.(If you have JavaScript for authentication logic):The form checks the input against hardcoded or demo credentials (if any are set).On success, the user can be redirected to the shop or shown a login success message.On failure, an error message is shown.The form uses basic client-side validation—no passwords are stored.For testing:Enter any username and password to see the interaction (customize this section if you have specific allowed/demo credentials).Getting StartedClone or download this repository.Open index.html (or the GitHub Pages link) in your browser.Try navigating between the login and shop pages
